      "\n",
      "My mother died in July 1817, when I was a little over eight years old,\n",

      "her death-bed, her black velvet gown, and her curiously constructed\n",

      "I was in many ways a naughty boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time I went to this day-school (Kept by Rev. G. Case, minister of\n",
      "the Unitarian Chapel in the High Street. Mrs. Darwin was a Unitarian\n",
      "and attended Mr. Case's chapel, and my father as a little boy went there\n",

      "been erected to his memory in the chapel, which is now known as the\n",

      "especially for collecting, was well developed. I tried to make out\n",
      "the names of plants (Rev. W.A. Leighton, who was a schoolfellow of my\n",

      "and saying that his mother had taught him how by looking at the inside\n",
      "of the blossom the name of the plant could be discovered. Mr. Leighton\n",
      "goes on, \"This greatly roused my attention and curiosity, and I enquired\n",
      "of him repeatedly how this could be done?\"--but his lesson was naturally\n",
      "enough not transmissible.--F.D.), and collected all sorts of things,\n",
      "shells, seals, franks, coins, and minerals. The passion for collecting\n",
      "which leads a man to be a systematic naturalist, a virtuoso, or a miser,\n",
      "was very strong in me, and was clearly innate, as none of my sisters or\n",
      "brother ever had this taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "One little event during this year has fixed itself very firmly in my\n",
      "mind, and I hope that it has done so from my conscience having been\n",
      "afterwards sorely troubled by it; it is curious as showing that\n",
      "apparently I was interested at this early age in the variability of\n",
      "plants! I told another little boy (I believe it was Leighton, who\n",
      "afterwards became a well-known lichenologist and botanist), that I could\n",
      "produce variously coloured polyanthuses and primroses by watering them\n",
      "with certain coloured fluids, which was of course a monstrous fable, and\n",
      "had never been tried by me. I may here also confess that as a little boy\n",
      "I was much given to inventing deliberate falsehoods, and this was always\n",
      "done for the sake of causing excitement. For instance, I once gathered\n",
      "much valuable fruit from my father's trees and hid it in the shrubbery,\n",
      "and then ran in breathless haste to spread the news that I had\n",
      "discovered a hoard of stolen fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must have been a very simple little fellow when I first went to the\n",
      "school. A boy of the name of Garnett took me into a cake shop one day,\n",
      "and bought some cakes for which he did not pay, as the shopman trusted\n",
      "him. When we came out I asked him why he did not pay for them, and he\n",
      "instantly answered, \"Why, do you not know that my uncle left a great\n",
      "sum of money to the town on condition that every tradesman should give\n",
      "whatever was wanted without payment to any one who wore his old hat and\n",
      "moved [it] in a particular manner?\" and he then showed me how it was\n",
      "moved. He then went into another shop where he was trusted, and asked\n",
      "for some small article, moving his hat in the proper manner, and of\n",
      "course obtained it without payment. When we came out he said, \"Now if\n",
      "you like to go by yourself into that cake-shop (how well I remember its\n",
      "exact position) I will lend you my hat, and you can get whatever you\n",
      "like if you move the hat on your head properly.\" I gladly accepted the\n",
      "generous offer, and went in and asked for some cakes, moved the old hat\n",
      "and was walking out of the shop, when the shopman made a rush at me, so\n",
      "I dropped the cakes and ran for dear life, and was astonished by being\n",
      "greeted with shouts of laughter by my false friend Garnett.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can say in my own favour that I was as a boy humane, but I owed this\n",
      "entirely to the instruction and example of my sisters. I doubt indeed\n",
      "whether humanity is a natural or innate quality. I was very fond of\n",
      "collecting eggs, but I never took more than a single egg out of a bird's\n",
      "nest, except on one single occasion, when I took all, not for their\n",
      "value, but from a sort of bravado.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a strong taste for angling, and would sit for any number of hours\n",
      "on the bank of a river or pond watching the float; when at Maer (The\n",
      "house of his uncle, Josiah Wedgwood.) I was told that I could kill the\n",
      "worms with salt and water, and from that day I never spitted a living\n",
      "worm, though at the expense probably of some loss of success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once as a very little boy whilst at the day school, or before that time,\n",
      "I acted cruelly, for I beat a puppy, I believe, simply from enjoying\n",
      "the sense of power; but the beating could not have been severe, for\n",
      "the puppy did not howl, of which I feel sure, as the spot was near\n",
      "the house. This act lay heavily on my conscience, as is shown by my\n",
      "remembering the exact spot where the crime was committed. It probably\n",
      "lay all the heavier from my love of dogs being then, and for a long time\n",
      "afterwards, a passion. Dogs seemed to know this, for I was an adept in\n",
      "robbing their love from their masters.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember clearly only one other incident during this year whilst at\n",
      "Mr. Case's daily school,--namely, the burial of a dragoon soldier; and\n",
      "it is surprising how clearly I can still see the horse with the man's\n",
      "empty boots and carbine suspended to the saddle, and the firing over the\n",
      "grave. This scene deeply stirred whatever poetic fancy there was in me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the summer of 1818 I went to Dr. Butler's great school in Shrewsbury,\n",
      "and remained there for seven years still Midsummer 1825, when I was\n",
      "sixteen years old. I boarded at this school, so that I had the great\n",
      "advantage of living the life of a true schoolboy; but as the distance\n",
      "was hardly more than a mile to my home, I very often ran there in the\n",
      "longer intervals between the callings over and before locking up at\n",
      "night. This, I think, was in many ways advantageous to me by keeping up\n",
      "home affections and interests. I remember in the early part of my school\n",
      "life that I often had to run very quickly to be in time, and from being\n",
      "a fleet runner was generally successful; but when in doubt I prayed\n",
      "earnestly to God to help me, and I well remember that I attributed my\n",
      "success to the prayers and not to my quick running, and marvelled how\n",
      "generally I was aided.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard my father and elder sister say that I had, as a very young\n",
      "boy, a strong taste for long solitary walks; but what I thought about I\n",
      "know not. I often became quite absorbed, and once, whilst returning to\n",
      "school on the summit of the old fortifications round Shrewsbury, which\n",
      "had been converted into a public foot-path with no parapet on one side,\n",
      "I walked off and fell to the ground, but the height was only seven or\n",
      "eight feet. Nevertheless the number of thoughts which passed through my\n",
      "mind during this very short, but sudden and wholly unexpected fall, was\n",
      "astonishing, and seem hardly compatible with what physiologists have, I\n",
      "believe, proved about each thought requiring quite an appreciable amount\n",
      "of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could have been worse for the development of my mind than\n",
      "Dr. Butler's school, as it was strictly classical, nothing else being\n",
      "taught, except a little ancient geography and history. The school as a\n",
      "means of education to me was simply a blank. During my whole life I have\n",
      "been singularly incapable of mastering any language. Especial attention\n",
      "was paid to verse-making, and this I could never do well. I had many\n",
      "friends, and got together a good collection of old verses, which by\n",
      "patching together, sometimes aided by other boys, I could work into any\n",
      "subject. Much attention was paid to learning by heart the lessons of the\n",
      "previous day; this I could effect with great facility, learning forty or\n",
      "fifty lines of Virgil or Homer, whilst I was in morning chapel; but\n",
      "this exercise was utterly useless, for every verse was forgotten\n",
      "in forty-eight hours. I was not idle, and with the exception of\n",
      "versification, generally worked conscientiously at my classics, not\n",
      "using cribs. The sole pleasure I ever received from such studies, was\n",
      "from some of the odes of Horace, which I admired greatly.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I left the school I was for my age neither high nor low in it; and\n",
      "I believe that I was considered by all my masters and by my father as a\n",
      "very ordinary boy, rather below the common standard in intellect. To my\n",
      "deep mortification my father once said to me, \"You care for nothing but\n",
      "shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself\n",
      "and all your family.\" But my father, who was the kindest man I ever\n",
      "knew and whose memory I love with all my heart, must have been angry and\n",
      "somewhat unjust when he used such words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back as well as I can at my character during my school life, the\n",
      "only qualities which at this period promised well for the future,\n",
      "were, that I had strong and diversified tastes, much zeal for whatever\n",
      "interested me, and a keen pleasure in understanding any complex subject\n",
      "or thing. I was taught Euclid by a private tutor, and I distinctly\n",
      "remember the intense satisfaction which the clear geometrical proofs\n",
      "gave me. I remember, with equal distinctness, the delight which my uncle\n",
      "gave me (the father of Francis Galton) by explaining the principle\n",
      "of the vernier of a barometer with respect to diversified tastes,\n",
      "independently of science, I was fond of reading various books, and\n",
      "I used to sit for hours reading the historical plays of Shakespeare,\n",
      "generally in an old window in the thick walls of the school. I read also\n",
      "other poetry, such as Thomson's 'Seasons,' and the recently published\n",
      "poems of Byron and Scott. I mention this because later in life I\n",
      "wholly lost, to my great regret, all pleasure from poetry of any kind,\n",
      "including Shakespeare. In connection with pleasure from poetry, I may\n",
      "add that in 1822 a vivid delight in scenery was first awakened in my\n",
      "mind, during a riding tour on the borders of Wales, and this has lasted\n",
      "longer than any other aesthetic pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in my school days a boy had a copy of the 'Wonders of the World,'\n",
      "which I often read, and disputed with other boys about the veracity of\n",
      "some of the statements; and I believe that this book first gave me a\n",
      "wish to travel in remote countries, which was ultimately fulfilled\n",
      "by the voyage of the \"Beagle\". In the latter part of my school life\n",
      "I became passionately fond of shooting; I do not believe that any\n",
      "one could have shown more zeal for the most holy cause than I did for\n",
      "shooting birds. How well I remember killing my first snipe, and my\n",
      "excitement was so great that I had much difficulty in reloading my gun\n",
      "from the trembling of my hands. This taste long continued, and I became\n",
      "a very good shot. When at Cambridge I used to practise throwing up my\n",
      "gun to my shoulder before a looking-glass to see that I threw it up\n",
      "straight. Another and better plan was to get a friend to wave about a\n",
      "lighted candle, and then to fire at it with a cap on the nipple, and if\n",
      "the aim was accurate the little puff of air would blow out the candle.\n",
      "The explosion of the cap caused a sharp crack, and I was told that the\n",
      "tutor of the college remarked, \"What an extraordinary thing it is, Mr.\n",
      "Darwin seems to spend hours in cracking a horse-whip in his room, for I\n",
      "often hear the crack when I pass under his windows.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I had many friends amongst the schoolboys, whom I loved dearly, and I\n",
      "think that my disposition was then very affectionate.\n",
      "\n",
      "With respect to science, I continued collecting minerals with much zeal,\n",
      "but quite unscientifically--all that I cared about was a new-_named_\n",
      "mineral, and I hardly attempted to classify them. I must have observed\n",
      "insects with some little care, for when ten years old (1819) I went for\n",
      "three weeks to Plas Edwards on the sea-coast in Wales, I was very much\n",
      "interested and surprised at seeing a large black and scarlet Hemipterous\n",
      "insect, many moths (Zygaena), and a Cicindela which are not found in\n",
      "Shropshire. I almost made up my mind to begin collecting all the insects\n",
      "which I could find dead, for on consulting my sister I concluded that it\n",
      "was not right to kill insects for the sake of making a collection. From\n",
      "reading White's 'Selborne,' I took much pleasure in watching the\n",
      "habits of birds, and even made notes on the subject. In my simplicity I\n",
      "remember wondering why every gentleman did not become an ornithologist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the close of my school life, my brother worked hard at\n",
      "chemistry, and made a fair laboratory with proper apparatus in the\n",
      "tool-house in the garden, and I was allowed to aid him as a servant in\n",
      "most of his experiments. He made all the gases and many compounds, and\n",
      "I read with great care several books on chemistry, such as Henry and\n",
      "Parkes' 'Chemical Catechism.' The subject interested me greatly, and we\n",
      "often used to go on working till rather late at night. This was the best\n",
      "part of my education at school, for it showed me practically the meaning\n",
      "of experimental science. The fact that we worked at chemistry somehow\n",
      "got known at school, and as it was an unprecedented fact, I was\n",
      "nicknamed \"Gas.\" I was also once publicly rebuked by the head-master,\n",
      "Dr. Butler, for thus wasting my time on such useless subjects; and he\n",
      "called me very unjustly a \"poco curante,\" and as I did not understand\n",
      "what he meant, it seemed to me a fearful reproach.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was doing no good at school, my father wisely took me away at a\n",
      "rather earlier age than usual, and sent me (Oct. 1825) to Edinburgh\n",
      "University with my brother, where I stayed for two years or sessions. My\n",
      "brother was completing his medical studies, though I do not believe he\n",
      "ever really intended to practise, and I was sent there to commence\n",
      "them. But soon after this period I became convinced from various small\n",
      "circumstances that my father would leave me property enough to subsist\n",
      "on with some comfort, though I never imagined that I should be so rich a\n",
      "man as I am; but my belief was sufficient to check any strenuous efforts\n",
      "to learn medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instruction at Edinburgh was altogether by lectures, and these were\n",
      "intolerably dull, with the exception of those on chemistry by Hope; but\n",
      "to my mind there are no advantages and many disadvantages in lectures\n",
      "compared with reading. Dr. Duncan's lectures on Materia Medica at 8\n",
      "o'clock on a winter's morning are something fearful to remember. Dr.----\n",
      "made his lectures on human anatomy as dull as he was himself, and the\n",
      "subject disgusted me. It has proved one of the greatest evils in my life\n",
      "that I was not urged to practise dissection, for I should soon have got\n",
      "over my disgust; and the practice would have been invaluable for all\n",
      "my future work. This has been an irremediable evil, as well as my\n",
      "incapacity to draw. I also attended regularly the clinical wards in the\n",
      "hospital. Some of the cases distressed me a good deal, and I still have\n",
      "vivid pictures before me of some of them; but I was not so foolish as to\n",
      "allow this to lessen my attendance. I cannot understand why this part\n",
      "of my medical course did not interest me in a greater degree; for during\n",
      "the summer before coming to Edinburgh I began attending some of the poor\n",
      "people, chiefly children and women in Shrewsbury: I wrote down as full\n",
      "an account as I could of the case with all the symptoms, and read them\n",
      "aloud to my father, who suggested further inquiries and advised me what\n",
      "medicines to give, which I made up myself. At one time I had at least a\n",
      "dozen patients, and I felt a keen interest in the work. My father, who\n",
      "was by far the best judge of character whom I ever knew, declared that\n",
      "I should make a successful physician,--meaning by this one who would\n",
      "get many patients. He maintained that the chief element of success was\n",
      "exciting confidence; but what he saw in me which convinced him that I\n",
      "should create confidence I know not. I also attended on two occasions\n",
      "the operating theatre in the hospital at Edinburgh, and saw two very\n",
      "bad operations, one on a child, but I rushed away before they were\n",
      "completed. Nor did I ever attend again, for hardly any inducement would\n",
      "have been strong enough to make me do so; this being long before the\n",
      "blessed days of chloroform. The two cases fairly haunted me for many a\n",
      "long year.\n",
      "\n",
      "My brother stayed only one year at the University, so that during the\n",
      "second year I was left to my own resources; and this was an advantage,\n",
      "for I became well acquainted with several young men fond of natural\n",
      "science. One of these was Ainsworth, who afterwards published his\n",
      "travels in Assyria; he was a Wernerian geologist, and knew a little\n",
      "about many subjects. Dr. Coldstream was a very different young man,\n",
      "prim, formal, highly religious, and most kind-hearted; he afterwards\n",
      "published some good zoological articles. A third young man was Hardie,\n",
      "who would, I think, have made a good botanist, but died early in\n",
      "India. Lastly, Dr. Grant, my senior by several years, but how I became\n",
      "acquainted with him I cannot remember; he published some first-rate\n",
      "zoological papers, but after coming to London as Professor in University\n",
      "College, he did nothing more in science, a fact which has always been\n",
      "inexplicable to me. I knew him well; he was dry and formal in manner,\n",
      "with much enthusiasm beneath this outer crust. He one day, when we were\n",
      "walking together, burst forth in high admiration of Lamarck and his\n",
      "views on evolution. I listened in silent astonishment, and as far as\n",
      "I can judge without any effect on my mind. I had previously read the\n",
      "'Zoonomia' of my grandfather, in which similar views are maintained, but\n",
      "without producing any effect on me. Nevertheless it is probable that the\n",
      "hearing rather early in life such views maintained and praised may\n",
      "have favoured my upholding them under a different form in my 'Origin of\n",
      "Species.' At this time I admired greatly the 'Zoonomia;' but on reading\n",
      "it a second time after an interval of ten or fifteen years, I was much\n",
      "disappointed; the proportion of speculation being so large to the facts\n",
      "given.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drs. Grant and Coldstream attended much to marine Zoology, and I often\n",
      "accompanied the former to collect animals in the tidal pools, which I\n",
      "dissected as well as I could. I also became friends with some of the\n",
      "Newhaven fishermen, and sometimes accompanied them when they trawled\n",
      "for oysters, and thus got many specimens. But from not having had any\n",
      "regular practice in dissection, and from possessing only a wretched\n",
      "microscope, my attempts were very poor. Nevertheless I made one\n",
      "interesting little discovery, and read, about the beginning of the year\n",
      "1826, a short paper on the subject before the Plinian Society. This was\n",
      "that the so-called ova of Flustra had the power of independent movement\n",
      "by means of cilia, and were in fact larvae. In another short paper I\n",
      "showed that the little globular bodies which had been supposed to be\n",
      "the young state of Fucus loreus were the egg-cases of the wormlike\n",
      "Pontobdella muricata.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Plinian Society was encouraged and, I believe, founded by Professor\n",
      "Jameson: it consisted of students and met in an underground room in\n",
      "the University for the sake of reading papers on natural science and\n",
      "discussing them. I used regularly to attend, and the meetings had a\n",
      "good effect on me in stimulating my zeal and giving me new congenial\n",
      "acquaintances. One evening a poor young man got up, and after stammering\n",
      "for a prodigious length of time, blushing crimson, he at last slowly\n",
      "got out the words, \"Mr. President, I have forgotten what I was going to\n",
      "say.\" The poor fellow looked quite overwhelmed, and all the members\n",
      "were so surprised that no one could think of a word to say to cover his\n",
      "confusion. The papers which were read to our little society were not\n",
      "printed, so that I had not the satisfaction of seeing my paper in print;\n",
      "but I believe Dr. Grant noticed my small discovery in his excellent\n",
      "memoir on Flustra.\n",

      "I was also a member of the Royal Medical Society, and attended pretty\n",
      "regularly; but as the subjects were exclusively medical, I did not much\n",
      "care about them. Much rubbish was talked there, but there were some good\n",
      "speakers, of whom the best was the present Sir J. Kay-Shuttleworth. Dr.\n",
      "Grant took me occasionally to the meetings of the Wernerian Society,\n",
      "where various papers on natural history were read, discussed, and\n",
      "afterwards published in the 'Transactions.' I heard Audubon deliver\n",
      "there some interesting discourses on the habits of N. American birds,\n",
      "sneering somewhat unjustly at Waterton. By the way, a negro lived in\n",
      "Edinburgh, who had travelled with Waterton, and gained his livelihood\n",
      "by stuffing birds, which he did excellently: he gave me lessons for\n",
      "payment, and I used often to sit with him, for he was a very pleasant\n",
      "and intelligent man.\n",

      "Mr. Leonard Horner also took me once to a meeting of the Royal Society\n",
      "of Edinburgh, where I saw Sir Walter Scott in the chair as President,\n",
      "and he apologised to the meeting as not feeling fitted for such a\n",
      "position. I looked at him and at the whole scene with some awe and\n",
      "reverence, and I think it was owing to this visit during my youth, and\n",
      "to my having attended the Royal Medical Society, that I felt the honour\n",
      "of being elected a few years ago an honorary member of both these\n",
      "Societies, more than any other similar honour. If I had been told at\n",
      "that time that I should one day have been thus honoured, I declare that\n",
      "I should have thought it as ridiculous and improbable, as if I had been\n",
      "told that I should be elected King of England.\n",

      "During my second year at Edinburgh I attended ----'s lectures on\n",
      "Geology and Zoology, but they were incredibly dull. The sole effect they\n",
      "produced on me was the determination never as long as I lived to read\n",
      "a book on Geology, or in any way to study the science. Yet I feel sure\n",
      "that I was prepared for a philosophical treatment of the subject; for\n",
      "an old Mr. Cotton in Shropshire, who knew a good deal about rocks,\n",
      "had pointed out to me two or three years previously a well-known large\n",
      "erratic boulder in the town of Shrewsbury, called the \"bell-stone\"; he\n",
      "told me that there was no rock of the same kind nearer than Cumberland\n",
      "or Scotland, and he solemnly assured me that the world would come to an\n",
      "end before any one would be able to explain how this stone came where\n",
      "it now lay. This produced a deep impression on me, and I meditated over\n",
      "this wonderful stone. So that I felt the keenest delight when I first\n",
      "read of the action of icebergs in transporting boulders, and I gloried\n",
      "in the progress of Geology. Equally striking is the fact that I, though\n",
      "now only sixty-seven years old, heard the Professor, in a field lecture\n",
      "at Salisbury Craigs, discoursing on a trapdyke, with amygdaloidal\n",
      "margins and the strata indurated on each side, with volcanic rocks all\n",
      "around us, say that it was a fissure filled with sediment from above,\n",
      "adding with a sneer that there were men who maintained that it had\n",
      "been injected from beneath in a molten condition. When I think of this\n",
      "lecture, I do not wonder that I determined never to attend to Geology.\n",
      "\n",
      "From attending ----'s lectures, I became acquainted with the curator\n",
      "of the museum, Mr. Macgillivray, who afterwards published a large\n",
      "and excellent book on the birds of Scotland. I had much interesting\n",
      "natural-history talk with him, and he was very kind to me. He gave me\n",
      "some rare shells, for I at that time collected marine mollusca, but with\n",
      "no great zeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "My summer vacations during these two years were wholly given up to\n",
      "amusements, though I always had some book in hand, which I read with\n",
      "interest. During the summer of 1826 I took a long walking tour with\n",
      "two friends with knapsacks on our backs through North wales. We walked\n",
      "thirty miles most days, including one day the ascent of Snowdon. I\n",
      "also went with my sister a riding tour in North Wales, a servant with\n",
      "saddle-bags carrying our clothes. The autumns were devoted to shooting\n",
      "chiefly at Mr. Owen's, at Woodhouse, and at my Uncle Jos's (Josiah\n",
      "Wedgwood, the son of the founder of the Etruria Works.) at Maer. My zeal\n",
      "was so great that I used to place my shooting-boots open by my bed-side\n",
      "when I went to bed, so as not to lose half a minute in putting them on\n",
      "in the morning; and on one occasion I reached a distant part of the Maer\n",
      "estate, on the 20th of August for black-game shooting, before I could\n",
      "see: I then toiled on with the game-keeper the whole day through thick\n",
      "heath and young Scotch firs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I kept an exact record of every bird which I shot throughout the whole\n",
      "season. One day when shooting at Woodhouse with Captain Owen, the eldest\n",
      "son, and Major Hill, his cousin, afterwards Lord Berwick, both of whom I\n",
      "liked very much, I thought myself shamefully used, for every time after\n",
      "I had fired and thought that I had killed a bird, one of the two acted\n",
      "as if loading his gun, and cried out, \"You must not count that bird,\n",
      "for I fired at the same time,\" and the gamekeeper, perceiving the joke,\n",
      "backed them up. After some hours they told me the joke, but it was no\n",
      "joke to me, for I had shot a large number of birds, but did not know how\n",
      "many, and could not add them to my list, which I used to do by making a\n",
      "knot in a piece of string tied to a button-hole. This my wicked friends\n",
      "had perceived.\n",
      "\n",
      "How I did enjoy shooting! But I think that I must have been\n",
      "half-consciously ashamed of my zeal, for I tried to persuade myself\n",
      "that shooting was almost an intellectual employment; it required so much\n",
      "skill to judge where to find most game and to hunt the dogs well.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my autumnal visits to Maer in 1827 was memorable from meeting\n",
      "there Sir J. Mackintosh, who was the best converser I ever listened\n",
      "to. I heard afterwards with a glow of pride that he had said, \"There\n",
      "is something in that young man that interests me.\" This must have been\n",
      "chiefly due to his perceiving that I listened with much interest to\n",
      "everything which he said, for I was as ignorant as a pig about his\n",
      "subjects of history, politics, and moral philosophy. To hear of praise\n",
      "from an eminent person, though no doubt apt or certain to excite vanity,\n",
      "is, I think, good for a young man, as it helps to keep him in the right\n",
      "course.\n",
      "\n",
      "My visits to Maer during these two or three succeeding years were quite\n",
      "delightful, independently of the autumnal shooting. Life there was\n",
      "perfectly free; the country was very pleasant for walking or riding;\n",
      "and in the evening there was much very agreeable conversation, not\n",
      "so personal as it generally is in large family parties, together with\n",
      "music. In the summer the whole family used often to sit on the steps\n",
      "of the old portico, with the flower-garden in front, and with the steep\n",
      "wooded bank opposite the house reflected in the lake, with here and\n",
      "there a fish rising or a water-bird paddling about. Nothing has left a\n",
      "more vivid picture on my mind than these evenings at Maer. I was\n",
      "also attached to and greatly revered my Uncle Jos; he was silent and\n",
      "reserved, so as to be a rather awful man; but he sometimes talked openly\n",
      "with me. He was the very type of an upright man, with the clearest\n",
      "judgment. I do not believe that any power on earth could have made him\n",
      "swerve an inch from what he considered the right course. I used to apply\n",
      "to him in my mind the well-known ode of Horace, now forgotten by me, in\n",
      "which the words \"nec vultus tyranni, etc.,\" come in.\n",

      "After having spent two sessions in Edinburgh, my father perceived, or\n",
      "he heard from my sisters, that I did not like the thought of being a\n",
      "physician, so he proposed that I should become a clergyman. He was very\n",
      "properly vehement against my turning into an idle sporting man, which\n",
      "then seemed my probable destination. I asked for some time to consider,\n",
      "as from what little I had heard or thought on the subject I had scruples\n",
      "about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the Church of England;\n",
      "though otherwise I liked the thought of being a country clergyman.\n",
      "Accordingly I read with care 'Pearson on the Creed,' and a few other\n",
      "books on divinity; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict\n",
      "and literal truth of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself\n",
      "that our Creed must be fully accepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering how fiercely I have been attacked by the orthodox, it seems\n",
      "ludicrous that I once intended to be a clergyman. Nor was this intention\n",
      "and my father's wish ever formerly given up, but died a natural death\n",
      "when, on leaving Cambridge, I joined the \"Beagle\" as naturalist. If the\n",
      "phrenologists are to be trusted, I was well fitted in one respect to be\n",
      "a clergyman. A few years ago the secretaries of a German psychological\n",
      "society asked me earnestly by letter for a photograph of myself; and\n",
      "some time afterwards I received the proceedings of one of the meetings,\n",
      "in which it seemed that the shape of my head had been the subject of a\n",
      "public discussion, and one of the speakers declared that I had the bump\n",
      "of reverence developed enough for ten priests.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it was decided that I should be a clergyman, it was necessary that I\n",
      "should go to one of the English universities and take a degree; but as\n",
      "I had never opened a classical book since leaving school, I found to\n",
      "my dismay, that in the two intervening years I had actually forgotten,\n",
      "incredible as it may appear, almost everything which I had learnt,\n",
      "even to some few of the Greek letters. I did not therefore proceed to\n",
      "Cambridge at the usual time in October, but worked with a private tutor\n",
      "in Shrewsbury, and went to Cambridge after the Christmas vacation, early\n",
      "in 1828. I soon recovered my school standard of knowledge, and could\n",
      "translate easy Greek books, such as Homer and the Greek Testament, with\n",
      "moderate facility.\n",

      "During the three years which I spent at Cambridge my time was wasted,\n",
      "as far as the academical studies were concerned, as completely as at\n",
      "Edinburgh and at school. I attempted mathematics, and even went during\n",
      "the summer of 1828 with a private tutor (a very dull man) to Barmouth,\n",
      "but I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my\n",
      "not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This\n",
      "impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted\n",
      "that I did not proceed far enough at least to understand something of\n",
      "the great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem\n",
      "to have an extra sense. But I do not believe that I should ever have\n",
      "succeeded beyond a very low grade. With respect to Classics I did\n",
      "nothing except attend a few compulsory college lectures, and the\n",
      "attendance was almost nominal. In my second year I had to work for a\n",
      "month or two to pass the Little-Go, which I did easily. Again, in my\n",
      "last year I worked with some earnestness for my final degree of B.A.,\n",
      "and brushed up my Classics, together with a little Algebra and Euclid,\n",
      "which latter gave me much pleasure, as it did at school. In order to\n",
      "pass the B.A. examination, it was also necessary to get up Paley's\n",
      "'Evidences of Christianity,' and his 'Moral Philosophy.' This was done\n",
      "in a thorough manner, and I am convinced that I could have written out\n",
      "the whole of the 'Evidences' with perfect correctness, but not of course\n",
      "in the clear language of Paley. The logic of this book and, as I may\n",
      "add, of his 'Natural Theology,' gave me as much delight as did Euclid.\n",
      "The careful study of these works, without attempting to learn any part\n",
      "by rote, was the only part of the academical course which, as I then\n",
      "felt and as I still believe, was of the least use to me in the education\n",
      "of my mind. I did not at that time trouble myself about Paley's\n",
      "premises; and taking these on trust, I was charmed and convinced by the\n",
      "long line of argumentation. By answering well the examination questions\n",
      "in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in\n",
      "Classics, I gained a good place among the oi polloi or crowd of men who\n",
      "do not go in for honours. Oddly enough, I cannot remember how high I\n",
      "stood, and my memory fluctuates between the fifth, tenth, or twelfth,\n",
      "name on the list. (Tenth in the list of January 1831.)\n",

      "Public lectures on several branches were given in the University,\n",
      "attendance being quite voluntary; but I was so sickened with lectures at\n",
      "Edinburgh that I did not even attend Sedgwick's eloquent and interesting\n",
      "lectures. Had I done so I should probably have become a geologist\n",
      "earlier than I did. I attended, however, Henslow's lectures on Botany,\n",
      "and liked them much for their extreme clearness, and the admirable\n",
      "illustrations; but I did not study botany. Henslow used to take his\n",
      "pupils, including several of the older members of the University, field\n",
      "excursions, on foot or in coaches, to distant places, or in a barge\n",
      "down the river, and lectured on the rarer plants and animals which were\n",

      "Although, as we shall presently see, there were some redeeming features\n",
      "in my life at Cambridge, my time was sadly wasted there, and worse than\n",
      "wasted. From my passion for shooting and for hunting, and, when this\n",
      "failed, for riding across country, I got into a sporting set, including\n",
      "some dissipated low-minded young men. We used often to dine together in\n",
      "the evening, though these dinners often included men of a higher stamp,\n",
      "and we sometimes drank too much, with jolly singing and playing at cards\n",
      "afterwards. I know that I ought to feel ashamed of days and evenings\n",
      "thus spent, but as some of my friends were very pleasant, and we were\n",
      "all in the highest spirits, I cannot help looking back to these times\n",
      "with much pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am glad to think that I had many other friends of a widely\n",
      "different nature. I was very intimate with Whitley (Rev. C. Whitley,\n",
      "Hon. Canon of Durham, formerly Reader in Natural Philosophy in\n",
      "Durham University.), who was afterwards Senior Wrangler, and we used\n",
      "continually to take long walks together. He inoculated me with a taste\n",
      "for pictures and good engravings, of which I bought some. I frequently\n",
      "went to the Fitzwilliam Gallery, and my taste must have been fairly\n",
      "good, for I certainly admired the best pictures, which I discussed with\n",
      "the old curator. I read also with much interest Sir Joshua Reynolds'\n",
      "book. This taste, though not natural to me, lasted for several years,\n",
      "and many of the pictures in the National Gallery in London gave me\n",
      "much pleasure; that of Sebastian del Piombo exciting in me a sense of\n",
      "sublimity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also got into a musical set, I believe by means of my warm-hearted\n",
      "friend, Herbert (The late John Maurice Herbert, County Court Judge of\n",
      "Cardiff and the Monmouth Circuit.), who took a high wrangler's degree.\n",
      "From associating with these men, and hearing them play, I acquired a\n",
      "strong taste for music, and used very often to time my walks so as to\n",
      "hear on week days the anthem in King's College Chapel. This gave me\n",
      "intense pleasure, so that my backbone would sometimes shiver. I am sure\n",
      "that there was no affectation or mere imitation in this taste, for I\n",
      "used generally to go by myself to King's College, and I sometimes hired\n",

      "derived pleasure from music.\n",
      "\n",
      "My musical friends soon perceived my state, and sometimes amused\n",
      "themselves by making me pass an examination, which consisted in\n",
      "ascertaining how many tunes I could recognise when they were played\n",
      "rather more quickly or slowly than usual. 'God save the King,' when thus\n",
      "played, was a sore puzzle. There was another man with almost as bad an\n",
      "ear as I had, and strange to say he played a little on the flute. Once I\n",
      "had the triumph of beating him in one of our musical examinations.\n",

      "But no pursuit at Cambridge was followed with nearly so much eagerness\n",
      "or gave me so much pleasure as collecting beetles. It was the mere\n",
      "passion for collecting, for I did not dissect them, and rarely compared\n",
      "their external characters with published descriptions, but got them\n",
      "named anyhow. I will give a proof of my zeal: one day, on tearing off\n",
      "some old bark, I saw two rare beetles, and seized one in each hand; then\n",
      "I saw a third and new kind, which I could not bear to lose, so that I\n",
      "popped the one which I held in my right hand into my mouth. Alas! it\n",
      "ejected some intensely acrid fluid, which burnt my tongue so that I was\n",
      "forced to spit the beetle out, which was lost, as was the third one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was very successful in collecting, and invented two new methods; I\n",
      "employed a labourer to scrape during the winter, moss off old trees\n",
      "and place it in a large bag, and likewise to collect the rubbish at the\n",
      "bottom of the barges in which reeds are brought from the fens, and thus\n",
      "I got some very rare species. No poet ever felt more delighted at\n",
      "seeing his first poem published than I did at seeing, in Stephens'\n",

      "appearance of certain posts, old trees and banks where I made a good\n",
      "capture. The pretty Panagaeus crux-major was a treasure in those days,\n",
      "and here at Down I saw a beetle running across a walk, and on picking it\n",
      "up instantly perceived that it differed slightly from P. crux-major,\n",
      "and it turned out to be P. quadripunctatus, which is only a variety or\n",
      "closely allied species, differing from it very slightly in outline. I\n",
      "had never seen in those old days Licinus alive, which to an uneducated\n",
      "eye hardly differs from many of the black Carabidous beetles; but my\n",

      "all undergraduates, and some older members of the University, who were\n",
      "attached to science, used to meet in the evening. I soon got, through\n",
      "Fox, an invitation, and went there regularly. Before long I became\n",
      "well acquainted with Henslow, and during the latter half of my time at\n",
      "Cambridge took long walks with him on most days; so that I was called by\n",
      "some of the dons \"the man who walks with Henslow;\" and in the evening I\n",
      "was very often asked to join his family dinner. His knowledge was great\n",
      "in botany, entomology, chemistry, mineralogy, and geology. His strongest\n",
      "taste was to draw conclusions from long-continued minute observations.\n",
      "His judgment was excellent, and his whole mind well balanced; but I\n",
      "do not suppose that any one would say that he possessed much original\n",
      "genius. He was deeply religious, and so orthodox that he told me one day\n",
      "he should be grieved if a single word of the Thirty-nine Articles were\n",
      "altered. His moral qualities were in every way admirable. He was free\n",
      "from every tinge of vanity or other petty feeling; and I never saw a man\n",
      "who thought so little about himself or his own concerns. His temper was\n",
      "imperturbably good, with the most winning and courteous manners; yet,\n",
      "as I have seen, he could be roused by any bad action to the warmest\n",
      "indignation and prompt action.\n",

      "I once saw in his company in the streets of Cambridge almost as horrid\n",
      "a scene as could have been witnessed during the French Revolution. Two\n",
      "body-snatchers had been arrested, and whilst being taken to prison had\n",
      "been torn from the constable by a crowd of the roughest men, who dragged\n",
      "them by their legs along the muddy and stony road. They were covered\n",
      "from head to foot with mud, and their faces were bleeding either from\n",
      "having been kicked or from the stones; they looked like corpses, but\n",
      "the crowd was so dense that I got only a few momentary glimpses of the\n",
      "wretched creatures. Never in my life have I seen such wrath painted on\n",
      "a man's face as was shown by Henslow at this horrid scene. He tried\n",
      "repeatedly to penetrate the mob; but it was simply impossible. He then\n",
      "rushed away to the mayor, telling me not to follow him, but to get more\n",

      "hope was, an inestimable benefit. I cannot resist mentioning a trifling\n",
      "incident, which showed his kind consideration. Whilst examining some\n",
      "pollen-grains on a damp surface, I saw the tubes exserted, and instantly\n",
      "rushed off to communicate my surprising discovery to him. Now I do not\n",

      "coming in such a hurry to make such a communication. But he agreed how\n",
      "interesting the phenomenon was, and explained its meaning, but made me\n",
      "clearly understand how well it was known; so I left him not in the\n",
      "least mortified, but well pleased at having discovered for myself so\n",

      "Dr. Whewell was one of the older and distinguished men who sometimes\n",

      "superior to the common run of youths, otherwise the above-mentioned men,\n",
      "so much older than me and higher in academical position, would never\n",
      "have allowed me to associate with them. Certainly I was not aware of any\n",

      "a burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble\n",
      "structure of Natural Science. No one or a dozen other books influenced\n",
      "me nearly so much as these two. I copied out from Humboldt long passages\n",

      "As I had at first come up to Cambridge at Christmas, I was forced to\n",
      "keep two terms after passing my final examination, at the commencement\n",
      "of 1831; and Henslow then persuaded me to begin the study of geology.\n",
      "Therefore on my return to Shropshire I examined sections, and coloured\n",
      "a map of parts round Shrewsbury. Professor Sedgwick intended to visit\n",
      "North Wales in the beginning of August to pursue his famous geological\n",
      "investigations amongst the older rocks, and Henslow asked him to allow\n",
      "me to accompany him. (In connection with this tour my father used\n",
      "to tell a story about Sedgwick: they had started from their inn one\n",
      "morning, and had walked a mile or two, when Sedgwick suddenly stopped,\n",
      "and vowed that he would return, being certain \"that damned scoundrel\"\n",
      "(the waiter) had not given the chambermaid the sixpence intrusted to\n",
      "him for the purpose. He was ultimately persuaded to give up the project,\n",

      "\n",
      "A short conversation with him during this evening produced a strong\n",
      "impression on my mind. Whilst examining an old gravel-pit near\n",
      "Shrewsbury, a labourer told me that he had found in it a large worn\n",
      "tropical Volute shell, such as may be seen on the chimney-pieces of\n",
      "cottages; and as he would not sell the shell, I was convinced that he\n",
      "had really found it in the pit. I told Sedgwick of the fact, and he at\n",
      "once said (no doubt truly) that it must have been thrown away by some\n",
      "one into the pit; but then added, if really embedded there it would be\n",
      "the greatest misfortune to geology, as it would overthrow all that\n",
      "we know about the superficial deposits of the Midland Counties. These\n",
      "gravel-beds belong in fact to the glacial period, and in after years I\n",
      "found in them broken arctic shells. But I was then utterly astonished at\n",
      "Sedgwick not being delighted at so wonderful a fact as a tropical shell\n",
      "being found near the surface in the middle of England. Nothing\n",
      "before had ever made me thoroughly realise, though I had read various\n",

      "general laws or conclusions may be drawn from them.\n",

      "Next morning we started for Llangollen, Conway, Bangor, and Capel Curig.\n",
      "This tour was of decided use in teaching me a little how to make out the\n",
      "geology of a country. Sedgwick often sent me on a line parallel to\n",
      "his, telling me to bring back specimens of the rocks and to mark the\n",
      "stratification on a map. I have little doubt that he did this for my\n",
      "good, as I was too ignorant to have aided him. On this tour I had a\n",
      "striking instance of how easy it is to overlook phenomena, however\n",
      "conspicuous, before they have been observed by any one. We spent many\n",
      "hours in Cwm Idwal, examining all the rocks with extreme care, as\n",
      "Sedgwick was anxious to find fossils in them; but neither of us saw\n",
      "a trace of the wonderful glacial phenomena all around us; we did not\n",
      "notice the plainly scored rocks, the perched boulders, the lateral and\n",
      "terminal moraines. Yet these phenomena are so conspicuous that, as\n",
      "I declared in a paper published many years afterwards in the\n",
      "'Philosophical Magazine' ('Philosophical Magazine,' 1842.), a house\n",
      "burnt down by fire did not tell its story more plainly than did this\n",

      "places, and enjoyed much this manner of travelling. I visited Barmouth\n",

      "give up part of his own cabin to any young man who would volunteer to go\n",
      "with him without pay as naturalist to the Voyage of the \"Beagle\". I\n",

      "circumstances which then occurred; I will here only say that I was\n",
      "instantly eager to accept the offer, but my father strongly objected,\n",
      "adding the words, fortunate for me, \"If you can find any man of common\n",
      "sense who advises you to go I will give my consent.\" So I wrote that\n",
      "evening and refused the offer. On the next morning I went to Maer to\n",
      "be ready for September 1st, and, whilst out shooting, my uncle (Josiah\n",
      "Wedgwood.) sent for me, offering to drive me over to Shrewsbury and talk\n",
      "with my father, as my uncle thought it would be wise in me to accept the\n",
      "offer. My father always maintained that he was one of the most sensible\n",
      "men in the world, and he at once consented in the kindest manner. I had\n",
      "been rather extravagant at Cambridge, and to console my father, said,\n",
      "\"that I should be deuced clever to spend more than my allowance whilst\n",

      "intimate with Fitz-Roy, I heard that I had run a very narrow risk of\n",
      "being rejected, on account of the shape of my nose! He was an ardent\n",
      "disciple of Lavater, and was convinced that he could judge of a man's\n",
      "character by the outline of his features; and he doubted whether any one\n",
      "with my nose could possess sufficient energy and determination for the\n",
      "voyage. But I think he was afterwards well satisfied that my nose had\n",
      "spoken falsely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fitz-Roy's character was a singular one, with very many noble features:\n",
      "he was devoted to his duty, generous to a fault, bold, determined, and\n",
      "indomitably energetic, and an ardent friend to all under his sway. He\n",
      "would undertake any sort of trouble to assist those whom he thought\n",
      "deserved assistance. He was a handsome man, strikingly like a gentleman,\n",
      "with highly courteous manners, which resembled those of his maternal\n",
      "uncle, the famous Lord Castlereagh, as I was told by the Minister at\n",
      "Rio. Nevertheless he must have inherited much in his appearance from\n",
      "Charles II., for Dr. Wallich gave me a collection of photographs which\n",
      "he had made, and I was struck with the resemblance of one to Fitz-Roy;\n",
      "and on looking at the name, I found it Ch. E. Sobieski Stuart, Count\n",
      "d'Albanie, a descendant of the same monarch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fitz-Roy's temper was a most unfortunate one. It was usually worst in\n",
      "the early morning, and with his eagle eye he could generally detect\n",
      "something amiss about the ship, and was then unsparing in his blame. He\n",
      "was very kind to me, but was a man very difficult to live with on the\n",
      "intimate terms which necessarily followed from our messing by ourselves\n",
      "in the same cabin. We had several quarrels; for instance, early in the\n",
      "voyage at Bahia, in Brazil, he defended and praised slavery, which I\n",
      "abominated, and told me that he had just visited a great slave-owner,\n",
      "who had called up many of his slaves and asked them whether they were\n",
      "happy, and whether they wished to be free, and all answered \"No.\" I then\n",
      "asked him, perhaps with a sneer, whether he thought that the answer of\n",
      "slaves in the presence of their master was worth anything? This made him\n",
      "excessively angry, and he said that as I doubted his word we could not\n",
      "live any longer together. I thought that I should have been compelled to\n",
      "leave the ship; but as soon as the news spread, which it did quickly,\n",
      "as the captain sent for the first lieutenant to assuage his anger by\n",
      "abusing me, I was deeply gratified by receiving an invitation from all\n",
      "the gun-room officers to mess with them. But after a few hours Fitz-Roy\n",
      "showed his usual magnanimity by sending an officer to me with an apology\n",
      "and a request that I would continue to live with him.\n",

      "small a circumstance as my uncle offering to drive me thirty miles to\n",
      "Shrewsbury, which few uncles would have done, and on such a trifle as\n",
      "the shape of my nose. I have always felt that I owe to the voyage the\n",
      "first real training or education of my mind; I was led to attend\n",
      "closely to several branches of natural history, and thus my powers of\n",
      "observation were improved, though they were always fairly developed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigation of the geology of all the places visited was far more\n",
      "important, as reasoning here comes into play. On first examining a new\n",

      "by recording the stratification and nature of the rocks and fossils\n",
      "at many points, always reasoning and predicting what will be found\n",
      "elsewhere, light soon begins to dawn on the district, and the structure\n",
      "of the whole becomes more or less intelligible. I had brought with me\n",
      "the first volume of Lyell's 'Principles of Geology,' which I studied\n",
      "attentively; and the book was of the highest service to me in many ways.\n",
      "The very first place which I examined, namely St. Jago in the Cape de\n",
      "Verde islands, showed me clearly the wonderful superiority of Lyell's\n",
      "manner of treating geology, compared with that of any other author,\n",
      "whose works I had with me or ever afterwards read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another of my occupations was collecting animals of all classes, briefly\n",
      "describing and roughly dissecting many of the marine ones; but from not\n",
      "being able to draw, and from not having sufficient anatomical knowledge,\n",
      "a great pile of MS. which I made during the voyage has proved almost\n",
      "useless. I thus lost much time, with the exception of that spent in\n",
      "acquiring some knowledge of the Crustaceans, as this was of service when\n",
      "in after years I undertook a monograph of the Cirripedia.\n",
      "\n",
      "During some part of the day I wrote my Journal, and took much pains in\n",
      "describing carefully and vividly all that I had seen; and this was good\n",
      "practice. My Journal served also, in part, as letters to my home, and\n",
      "portions were sent to England whenever there was an opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above various special studies were, however, of no importance\n",

      "attention to whatever I was engaged in, which I then acquired.\n",
      "Everything about which I thought or read was made to bear directly\n",
      "on what I had seen or was likely to see; and this habit of mind was\n",

      "science.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking backwards, I can now perceive how my love for science gradually\n",

      "gun more and more, and finally altogether, to my servant, as shooting\n",
      "interfered with my work, more especially with making out the geological\n",

      "through my pursuits during the voyage is rendered probable by a remark\n",
      "made by my father, who was the most acute observer whom I ever saw, of a\n",
      "sceptical disposition, and far from being a believer in phrenology; for\n",

      "my father and sisters a long farewell. On October 24th I took up my\n",
      "residence at Plymouth, and remained there until December 27th, when the\n",
      "\"Beagle\" finally left the shores of England for her circumnavigation of\n",
      "the world. We made two earlier attempts to sail, but were driven back\n",
      "each time by heavy gales. These two months at Plymouth were the most\n",
      "miserable which I ever spent, though I exerted myself in various ways.\n",
      "I was out of spirits at the thought of leaving all my family and friends\n",
      "for so long a time, and the weather seemed to me inexpressibly gloomy.\n",
      "I was also troubled with palpitation and pain about the heart, and like\n",
      "many a young ignorant man, especially one with a smattering of medical\n",
      "knowledge, was convinced that I had heart disease. I did not consult any\n",

      "the sense of sublimity, which the great deserts of Patagonia and the\n",
      "forest-clad mountains of Tierra del Fuego excited in me, has left an\n",

      "excursions on horseback through wild countries, or in the boats, some\n",
      "of which lasted several weeks, were deeply interesting: their discomfort\n",
      "and some degree of danger were at that time hardly a drawback, and none\n",
      "at all afterwards. I also reflect with high satisfaction on some of\n",
      "my scientific work, such as solving the problem of coral islands, and\n",

      "poured forth lava. It then first dawned on me that I might perhaps write\n",
      "a book on the geology of the various countries visited, and this made me\n",
      "thrill with delight. That was a memorable hour to me, and how distinctly\n",
      "I can call to mind the low cliff of lava beneath which I rested, with\n",
      "the sun glaring hot, a few strange desert plants growing near, and\n",
      "with living corals in the tidal pools at my feet. Later in the voyage,\n",

      "truth that in after years, though I cared in the highest degree for the\n",
      "approbation of such men as Lyell and Hooker, who were my friends, I\n",
      "did not care much about the general public. I do not mean to say that a\n",

      "The greater part of my time, when I could do anything, was devoted to\n",
      "my work on 'Coral Reefs,' which I had begun before my marriage, and of\n",
      "which the last proof-sheet was corrected on May 6th, 1842. This book,\n",
      "though a small one, cost me twenty months of hard work, as I had to read\n",
      "every work on the islands of the Pacific and to consult many charts. It\n",
      "was thought highly of by scientific men, and the theory therein given\n",
      "is, I think, now well established.\n",
      "\n",
      "No other work of mine was begun in so deductive a spirit as this, for\n",
      "the whole theory was thought out on the west coast of South America,\n",
      "before I had seen a true coral reef. I had therefore only to verify and\n",
      "extend my views by a careful examination of living reefs. But it should\n",
      "be observed that I had during the two previous years been incessantly\n",
      "attending to the effects on the shores of South America of the\n",
      "intermittent elevation of the land, together with denudation and the\n",
      "deposition of sediment. This necessarily led me to reflect much on the\n",
      "effects of subsidence, and it was easy to replace in imagination the\n",
      "continued deposition of sediment by the upward growth of corals. To do\n",
      "this was to form my theory of the formation of barrier-reefs and atolls.\n",

      "clearness, caution, sound judgment, and a good deal of originality. When\n",
      "I made any remark to him on Geology, he never rested until he saw the\n",
      "whole case clearly, and often made me see it more clearly than I had\n",
      "done before. He would advance all possible objections to my suggestion,\n",
      "and even after these were exhausted would long remain dubious. A second\n",

      "men. (The slight repetition here observable is accounted for by the\n",

      "after the rest of the 'Recollections' were written.)\n",
      "\n",
      "On my return from the voyage of the \"Beagle\", I explained to him\n",
      "my views on coral-reefs, which differed from his, and I was greatly\n",
      "surprised and encouraged by the vivid interest which he showed. His\n",
      "delight in science was ardent, and he felt the keenest interest in the\n",
      "future progress of mankind. He was very kind-hearted, and thoroughly\n",
      "liberal in his religious beliefs, or rather disbeliefs; but he was a\n",
      "strong theist. His candour was highly remarkable. He exhibited this by\n",
      "becoming a convert to the Descent theory, though he had gained much\n",
      "fame by opposing Lamarck's views, and this after he had grown old. He\n",
      "reminded me that I had many years before said to him, when discussing\n",
      "the opposition of the old school of geologists to his new views, \"What\n",

      "just been published, but on no account to accept the views therein\n",
      "advocated. How differently would anyone now speak of the 'Principles'! I\n",

      "I saw a good deal of Robert Brown, \"facile Princeps Botanicorum,\" as he\n",

      "the minuteness of his observations, and their perfect accuracy. His\n",
      "knowledge was extraordinarily great, and much died with him, owing to\n",
      "his excessive fear of ever making a mistake. He poured out his knowledge\n",

      "points. I called on him two or three times before the voyage of the\n",

      "health, and quite unfit for any exertion, he daily visited (as Hooker\n",

      "high. I can remember nothing distinctly about our interview, except that\n",

      "\n",
      "--reminds me of Buckle whom I once met at Hensleigh Wedgwood's. I was\n",
      "very glad to learn from him his system of collecting facts. He told me\n",
      "that he bought all the books which he read, and made a full index, to\n",
      "each, of the facts which he thought might prove serviceable to him, and\n",
      "that he could always remember in what book he had read anything, for his\n",
      "memory was wonderful. I asked him how at first he could judge what facts\n",
      "would be serviceable, and he answered that he did not know, but that a\n",
      "sort of instinct guided him. From this habit of making indices, he was\n",
      "enabled to give the astonishing number of references on all sorts of\n",
      "subjects, which may be found in his 'History of Civilisation.' This book\n",
      "I thought most interesting, and read it twice, but I doubt whether his\n",
      "generalisations are worth anything. Buckle was a great talker, and I\n",
      "listened to him saying hardly a word, nor indeed could I have done so\n",
      "for he left no gaps. When Mrs. Farrer began to sing, I jumped up and\n",
      "said that I must listen to her; after I had moved away he turned around\n",
      "to a friend and said (as was overheard by my brother), \"Well, Mr.\n",

      "\n",
      "Of other great literary men, I once met Sydney Smith at Dean Milman's\n",
      "house. There was something inexplicably amusing in every word which he\n",
      "uttered. Perhaps this was partly due to the expectation of being amused.\n",
      "He was talking about Lady Cork, who was then extremely old. This was the\n",
      "lady who, as he said, was once so much affected by one of his charity\n",
      "sermons, that she _borrowed_ a guinea from a friend to put in the plate.\n",
      "He now said \"It is generally believed that my dear old friend Lady Cork\n",

      "all too much; nor indeed could such a man talk too much, as long as he\n",
      "allowed others to turn the stream of his conversation, and this he did\n",
      "allow.\n",

      "In October, 1846, I began to work on 'Cirripedia.' When on the coast of\n",
      "Chile, I found a most curious form, which burrowed into the shells of\n",
      "Concholepas, and which differed so much from all other Cirripedes that\n",

      "burrowing genus has been found on the shores of Portugal. To understand\n",
      "the structure of my new Cirripede I had to examine and dissect many\n",
      "of the common forms; and this gradually led me on to take up the whole\n",
      "group. I worked steadily on this subject for the next eight years, and\n",
      "ultimately published two thick volumes (Published by the Ray Society.),\n",
      "describing all the known living species, and two thin quartos on the\n",
      "extinct species. I do not doubt that Sir E. Lytton Bulwer had me in his\n",

      "written two huge volumes on limpets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I was employed during eight years on this work, yet I record in\n",
      "my diary that about two years out of this time was lost by illness. On\n",
      "this account I went in 1848 for some months to Malvern for hydropathic\n",
      "treatment, which did me much good, so that on my return home I was able\n",
      "to resume work. So much was I out of health that when my dear father\n",

      "My work on the Cirripedia possesses, I think, considerable value, as\n",

      "homologies of the various parts--I discovered the cementing apparatus,\n",
      "though I blundered dreadfully about the cement glands--and lastly I\n",
      "proved the existence in certain genera of minute males complemental to\n",
      "and parasitic on the hermaphrodites. This latter discovery has at last\n",
      "been fully confirmed; though at one time a German writer was pleased to\n",
      "attribute the whole account to my fertile imagination. The Cirripedes\n",
      "form a highly varying and difficult group of species to class; and my\n",
      "work was of considerable use to me, when I had to discuss in the 'Origin\n",
      "of Species' the principles of a natural classification. Nevertheless, I\n",
      "doubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so much time.\n",

      "From September 1854 I devoted my whole time to arranging my huge\n",

      "deeply impressed by discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil\n",
      "animals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos;\n",
      "secondly, by the manner in which closely allied animals replace one\n",
      "another in proceeding southwards over the Continent; and thirdly, by\n",
      "the South American character of most of the productions of the Galapagos\n",
      "archipelago, and more especially by the manner in which they differ\n",
      "slightly on each island of the group; none of the islands appearing to\n",
      "be very ancient in a geological sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was evident that such facts as these, as well as many others, could\n",
      "only be explained on the supposition that species gradually become\n",
      "modified; and the subject haunted me. But it was equally evident that\n",
      "neither the action of the surrounding conditions, nor the will of the\n",
      "organisms (especially in the case of plants) could account for the\n",
      "innumerable cases in which organisms of every kind are beautifully\n",
      "adapted to their habits of life--for instance, a woodpecker or a\n",
      "tree-frog to climb trees, or a seed for dispersal by hooks or plumes. I\n",
      "had always been much struck by such adaptations, and until these could\n",

      "indirect evidence that species have been modified.\n",
      "\n",
      "After my return to England it appeared to me that by following the\n",
      "example of Lyell in Geology, and by collecting all facts which bore in\n",
      "any way on the variation of animals and plants under domestication and\n",
      "nature, some light might perhaps be thrown on the whole subject. My\n",
      "first note-book was opened in July 1837. I worked on true Baconian\n",
      "principles, and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale,\n",
      "more especially with respect to domesticated productions, by printed\n",
      "enquiries, by conversation with skilful breeders and gardeners, and by\n",
      "extensive reading. When I see the list of books of all kinds which\n",
      "I read and abstracted, including whole series of Journals and\n",
      "Transactions, I am surprised at my industry. I soon perceived that\n",
      "selection was the keystone of man's success in making useful races of\n",
      "animals and plants. But how selection could be applied to organisms\n",
      "living in a state of nature remained for some time a mystery to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic\n",
      "enquiry, I happened to read for amusement 'Malthus on Population,'\n",
      "and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which\n",
      "everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of\n",
      "animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances\n",
      "favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable\n",
      "ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new\n",
      "species. Here then I had at last got a theory by which to work; but I\n",
      "was so anxious to avoid prejudice, that I determined not for some time\n",
      "to write even the briefest sketch of it. In June 1842 I first allowed\n",
      "myself the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my theory in\n",
      "pencil in 35 pages; and this was enlarged during the summer of 1844 into\n",
      "one of 230 pages, which I had fairly copied out and still possess.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at that time I overlooked one problem of great importance; and it is\n",
      "astonishing to me, except on the principle of Columbus and his egg,\n",
      "how I could have overlooked it and its solution. This problem is the\n",
      "tendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in\n",
      "character as they become modified. That they have diverged greatly is\n",
      "obvious from the manner in which species of all kinds can be classed\n",
      "under genera, genera under families, families under sub-orders and\n",
      "so forth; and I can remember the very spot in the road, whilst in my\n",
      "carriage, when to my joy the solution occurred to me; and this was\n",
      "long after I had come to Down. The solution, as I believe, is that the\n",
      "modified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become\n",
      "adapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in 1856 Lyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully, and\n",
      "I began at once to do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as\n",
      "that which was afterwards followed in my 'Origin of Species;' yet it\n",
      "was only an abstract of the materials which I had collected, and I got\n",
      "through about half the work on this scale. But my plans were overthrown,\n",
      "for early in the summer of 1858 Mr. Wallace, who was then in the Malay\n",
      "archipelago, sent me an essay \"On the Tendency of Varieties to depart\n",
      "indefinitely from the Original Type;\" and this essay contained exactly\n",
      "the same theory as mine. Mr. Wallace expressed the wish that if I\n",
      "thought well of his essay, I should sent it to Lyell for perusal.\n",
      "\n",

      "Asa Gray, dated September 5, 1857, to be published at the same time with\n",
      "Wallace's Essay, are given in the 'Journal of the Proceedings of the\n",
      "Linnean Society,' 1858, page 45. I was at first very unwilling\n",
      "to consent, as I thought Mr. Wallace might consider my doing so\n",
      "unjustifiable, for I did not then know how generous and noble was his\n",
      "disposition. The extract from my MS. and the letter to Asa Gray had\n",
      "neither been intended for publication, and were badly written. Mr.\n",
      "Wallace's essay, on the other hand, was admirably expressed and\n",
      "quite clear. Nevertheless, our joint productions excited very little\n",
      "attention, and the only published notice of them which I can remember\n",
      "was by Professor Haughton of Dublin, whose verdict was that all that\n",
      "was new in them was false, and what was true was old. This shows how\n",
      "necessary it is that any new view should be explained at considerable\n",
      "length in order to arouse public attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 1858 I set to work by the strong advice of Lyell and Hooker\n",
      "to prepare a volume on the transmutation of species, but was often\n",
      "interrupted by ill-health, and short visits to Dr. Lane's delightful\n",
      "hydropathic establishment at Moor Park. I abstracted the MS. begun on a\n",
      "much larger scale in 1856, and completed the volume on the same reduced\n",
      "scale. It cost me thirteen months and ten days' hard labour. It was\n",
      "published under the title of the 'Origin of Species,' in November 1859.\n",
      "Though considerably added to and corrected in the later editions, it has\n",
      "remained substantially the same book.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is no doubt the chief work of my life. It was from the first highly\n",
      "successful. The first small edition of 1250 copies was sold on the day\n",
      "of publication, and a second edition of 3000 copies soon afterwards.\n",
      "Sixteen thousand copies have now (1876) been sold in England; and\n",
      "considering how stiff a book it is, this is a large sale. It has been\n",
      "translated into almost every European tongue, even into such languages\n",
      "as Spanish, Bohemian, Polish, and Russian. It has also, according to\n",
      "Miss Bird, been translated into Japanese (Miss Bird is mistaken, as I\n",
      "learn from Prof. Mitsukuri.--F.D.), and is there much studied. Even an\n",
      "essay in Hebrew has appeared on it, showing that the theory is contained\n",
      "in the Old Testament! The reviews were very numerous; for some time I\n",
      "collected all that appeared on the 'Origin' and on my related books, and\n",
      "these amount (excluding newspaper reviews) to 265; but after a time I\n",
      "gave up the attempt in despair. Many separate essays and books on the\n",
      "subject have appeared; and in Germany a catalogue or bibliography on\n",
      "\"Darwinismus\" has appeared every year or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The success of the 'Origin' may, I think, be attributed in large part to\n",
      "my having long before written two condensed sketches, and to my having\n",
      "finally abstracted a much larger manuscript, which was itself an\n",
      "abstract. By this means I was enabled to select the more striking facts\n",
      "and conclusions. I had, also, during many years followed a golden rule,\n",
      "namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought\n",
      "came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a\n",
      "memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience\n",
      "that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory\n",
      "than favourable ones. Owing to this habit, very few objections were\n",
      "raised against my views which I had not at least noticed and attempted\n",
      "to answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has sometimes been said that the success of the 'Origin' proved \"that\n",
      "the subject was in the air,\" or \"that men's minds were prepared for it.\"\n",
      "I do not think that this is strictly true, for I occasionally sounded\n",
      "not a few naturalists, and never happened to come across a single one\n",
      "who seemed to doubt about the permanence of species. Even Lyell and\n",
      "Hooker, though they would listen with interest to me, never seemed to\n",
      "agree. I tried once or twice to explain to able men what I meant by\n",
      "Natural Selection, but signally failed. What I believe was strictly\n",
      "true is that innumerable well-observed facts were stored in the minds\n",
      "of naturalists ready to take their proper places as soon as any theory\n",
      "which would receive them was sufficiently explained. Another element\n",
      "in the success of the book was its moderate size; and this I owe to the\n",
      "appearance of Mr. Wallace's essay; had I published on the scale in which\n",
      "I began to write in 1856, the book would have been four or five times as\n",
      "large as the 'Origin,' and very few would have had the patience to read\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the theory\n",
      "was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it, for I cared\n",
      "very little whether men attributed most originality to me or Wallace;\n",
      "and his essay no doubt aided in the reception of the theory. I was\n",
      "forestalled in only one important point, which my vanity has always made\n",
      "me regret, namely, the explanation by means of the Glacial period of\n",
      "the presence of the same species of plants and of some few animals on\n",
      "distant mountain summits and in the arctic regions. This view pleased me\n",
      "so much that I wrote it out in extenso, and I believe that it was read\n",
      "by Hooker some years before E. Forbes published his celebrated memoir\n",
      "('Geolog. Survey Mem.,' 1846.) on the subject. In the very few points in\n",
      "which we differed, I still think that I was in the right. I have never,\n",
      "of course, alluded in print to my having independently worked out this\n",
      "view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly any point gave me so much satisfaction when I was at work on\n",
      "the 'Origin,' as the explanation of the wide difference in many classes\n",
      "between the embryo and the adult animal, and of the close resemblance of\n",
      "the embryos within the same class. No notice of this point was taken, as\n",
      "far as I remember, in the early reviews of the 'Origin,' and I recollect\n",
      "expressing my surprise on this head in a letter to Asa Gray. Within late\n",
      "years several reviewers have given the whole credit to Fritz Muller and\n",
      "Hackel, who undoubtedly have worked it out much more fully, and in some\n",
      "respects more correctly than I did. I had materials for a whole chapter\n",
      "on the subject, and I ought to have made the discussion longer; for it\n",
      "is clear that I failed to impress my readers; and he who succeeds in\n",
      "doing so deserves, in my opinion, all the credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "This leads me to remark that I have almost always been treated honestly\n",
      "by my reviewers, passing over those without scientific knowledge as\n",
      "not worthy of notice. My views have often been grossly misrepresented,\n",
      "bitterly opposed and ridiculed, but this has been generally done, as I\n",
      "believe, in good faith. On the whole I do not doubt that my works have\n",
      "been over and over again greatly overpraised. I rejoice that I have\n",
      "avoided controversies, and this I owe to Lyell, who many years ago,\n",
      "in reference to my geological works, strongly advised me never to get\n",

      "which cost me ten months' work, was published: most of the facts had\n",
      "been slowly accumulated during several previous years. During the summer\n",
      "of 1839, and, I believe, during the previous summer, I was led to attend\n",
      "to the cross-fertilisation of flowers by the aid of insects, from having\n",
      "come to the conclusion in my speculations on the origin of species, that\n",
      "crossing played an important part in keeping specific forms constant. I\n",
      "attended to the subject more or less during every subsequent summer; and\n",
      "my interest in it was greatly enhanced by having procured and read\n",
      "in November 1841, through the advice of Robert Brown, a copy of C.K.\n",
      "Sprengel's wonderful book, 'Das entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur.' For\n",
      "some years before 1862 I had specially attended to the fertilisation\n",
      "of our British orchids; and it seemed to me the best plan to prepare as\n",
      "complete a treatise on this group of plants as well as I could, rather\n",
      "than to utilise the great mass of matter which I had slowly collected\n",
      "with respect to other plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "My resolve proved a wise one; for since the appearance of my book, a\n",
      "surprising number of papers and separate works on the fertilisation of\n",
      "all kinds of flowers have appeared: and these are far better done than\n",
      "I could possibly have effected. The merits of poor old Sprengel, so long\n",
      "overlooked, are now fully recognised many years after his death.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the same year I published in the 'Journal of the Linnean Society'\n",
      "a paper \"On the Two Forms, or Dimorphic Condition of Primula,\"\n",
      "and during the next five years, five other papers on dimorphic and\n",
      "trimorphic plants. I do not think anything in my scientific life has\n",
      "given me so much satisfaction as making out the meaning of the structure\n",
      "of these plants. I had noticed in 1838 or 1839 the dimorphism of Linum\n",
      "flavum, and had at first thought that it was merely a case of unmeaning\n",
      "variability. But on examining the common species of Primula I found that\n",
      "the two forms were much too regular and constant to be thus viewed. I\n",
      "therefore became almost convinced that the common cowslip and primrose\n",
      "were on the high road to become dioecious;--that the short pistil in the\n",
      "one form, and the short stamens in the other form were tending towards\n",
      "abortion. The plants were therefore subjected under this point of view\n",
      "to trial; but as soon as the flowers with short pistils fertilised with\n",
      "pollen from the short stamens, were found to yield more seeds than any\n",
      "other of the four possible unions, the abortion-theory was knocked on\n",
      "the head. After some additional experiment, it became evident that the\n",
      "two forms, though both were perfect hermaphrodites, bore almost the same\n",
      "relation to one another as do the two sexes of an ordinary animal. With\n",
      "Lythrum we have the still more wonderful case of three forms standing in\n",
      "a similar relation to one another. I afterwards found that the offspring\n",
      "from the union of two plants belonging to the same forms presented a\n",
      "close and curious analogy with hybrids from the union of two distinct\n",
      "species.\n",

      "In the autumn of 1864 I finished a long paper on 'Climbing Plants,' and\n",
      "sent it to the Linnean Society. The writing of this paper cost me four\n",
      "months; but I was so unwell when I received the proof-sheets that I was\n",
      "forced to leave them very badly and often obscurely expressed. The paper\n",
      "was little noticed, but when in 1875 it was corrected and published as a\n",
      "separate book it sold well. I was led to take up this subject by reading\n",
      "a short paper by Asa Gray, published in 1858. He sent me seeds, and\n",
      "on raising some plants I was so much fascinated and perplexed by the\n",
      "revolving movements of the tendrils and stems, which movements are\n",
      "really very simple, though appearing at first sight very complex, that\n",
      "I procured various other kinds of climbing plants, and studied the\n",
      "whole subject. I was all the more attracted to it, from not being at all\n",
      "satisfied with the explanation which Henslow gave us in his lectures,\n",
      "about twining plants, namely, that they had a natural tendency to grow\n",
      "up in a spire. This explanation proved quite erroneous. Some of the\n",

      "of facts collected from various sources, about our domestic productions.\n",
      "In the second volume the causes and laws of variation, inheritance,\n",
      "etc., are discussed as far as our present state of knowledge permits.\n",

      "hypothesis could be established, I shall have done good service, as an\n",
      "astonishing number of isolated facts can be thus connected together and\n",
      "rendered intelligible. In 1875 a second and largely corrected edition,\n",
      "which cost me a good deal of labour, was brought out.\n",

      "My 'Descent of Man' was published in February, 1871. As soon as I had\n",
      "become, in the year 1837 or 1838, convinced that species were mutable\n",
      "productions, I could not avoid the belief that man must come under\n",
      "the same law. Accordingly I collected notes on the subject for my own\n",
      "satisfaction, and not for a long time with any intention of publishing.\n",
      "Although in the 'Origin of Species' the derivation of any particular\n",
      "species is never discussed, yet I thought it best, in order that no\n",

      "But when I found that many naturalists fully accepted the doctrine of\n",
      "the evolution of species, it seemed to me advisable to work up such\n",
      "notes as I possessed, and to publish a special treatise on the origin of\n",
      "man. I was the more glad to do so, as it gave me an opportunity of\n",
      "fully discussing sexual selection--a subject which had always greatly\n",
      "interested me. This subject, and that of the variation of our\n",
      "domestic productions, together with the causes and laws of variation,\n",
      "inheritance, and the intercrossing of plants, are the sole subjects\n",
      "which I have been able to write about in full, so as to use all the\n",
      "materials which I have collected. The 'Descent of Man' took me three\n",
      "years to write, but then as usual some of this time was lost by ill\n",
      "health, and some was consumed by preparing new editions and other minor\n",
      "works. A second and largely corrected edition of the 'Descent' appeared\n",
      "in 1874.\n",

      "most complex and fine shades of expression must all have had a gradual\n",
      "and natural origin. During the summer of the following year, 1840,\n",
      "I read Sir C. Bell's admirable work on expression, and this greatly\n",
      "increased the interest which I felt in the subject, though I could not\n",
      "at all agree with his belief that various muscles had been specially\n",
      "created for the sake of expression. From this time forward I\n",
      "occasionally attended to the subject, both with respect to man and our\n",

      "insects saw the movements of the tentacles, and this made me think\n",
      "it probable that the insects were caught for some special purpose.\n",
      "Fortunately a crucial test occurred to me, that of placing a large\n",
      "number of leaves in various nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous fluids of\n",

      "collections of facts, but why this should have caused the atrophy of\n",
      "that part of the brain alone, on which the higher tastes depend, I\n",

    "## 12. Which books have similar content?\n",
    "<p>This turns out to be extremely useful if we want to determine a given book's most similar work. For example, we have just seen that if you enjoyed \"<em>On the Origin of Species</em>,\" you can read books discussing similar concepts such as \"<em>The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication</em>\" or \"<em>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</em>.\" If you are familiar with Darwin's work, these suggestions will likely seem natural to you. Indeed, <em>On the Origin of Species</em> has a whole chapter about domestication and <em>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</em> applies the theory of natural selection to human evolution. Hence, the results make sense.</p>\n",
    "<p>However, we now want to have a better understanding of the big picture and see how Darwin's books are generally related to each other (in terms of topics discussed). To this purpose, we will represent the whole similarity matrix as a dendrogram, which is a standard tool to display such data. <strong>This last approach will display all the information about book similarities at once.</strong> For example, we can find a book's closest relative but, also, we can visualize which groups of books have similar topics (e.g., the cluster about Charles Darwin personal life with his autobiography and letters). If you are familiar with Darwin's bibliography, the results should not surprise you too much, which indicates the method gives good results. Otherwise, next time you read one of the author's book, you will know which other books to read next in order to learn more about the topics it addressed.</p>"
