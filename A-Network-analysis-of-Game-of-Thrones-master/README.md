# A Network analysis of Game of Thrones

If you haven't heard of Game of Thrones, then you must be really good at hiding. Game of Thrones is the hugely popular television series by HBO based on the (also) hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. In this notebook, we will analyze the co-occurrence network of the characters in the Game of Thrones books. Here, two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from one another in the books. The raw data constitutes a network and is given as a text file describing the edges between characters, with some attributes attached to each edge. The project conducted a network analysis of Game of Thrones. It is documented in [notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/A-Network-analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones/blob/master/notebook.ipynb). The raw data files are also stored in the repository.
