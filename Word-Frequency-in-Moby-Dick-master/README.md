# Word Frequency in Moby Dick

What are the most frequent words in Herman Melville's novel, Moby Dick, and how often do they occur?
This project scraped the novel Moby Dick from the website Project Gutenberg (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package requests, extracted words from this web data using BeautifulSoup, and analyzed the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk). The Data Science pipeline can be used to visualize the word frequency distributions of any novel found on Project Gutenberg. The project is documented in [notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/Word-Frequency-in-Moby-Dick/blob/master/notebook.ipynb), together with the datasets.
