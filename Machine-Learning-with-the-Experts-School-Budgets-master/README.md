Explore a problem related to school district budgeting. By building a model to automatically classify items in a school's budget, it makes it easier and faster for schools to compare their spending with other schools. The data analysis is documented in [School_Budgets.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/Machine-Learning-with-the-Experts-School-Budgets/blob/master/School_Budgets.ipynb). The lecture notes and the raw data files are also stored in the repository. The summary of the content is shown below:
