# Exploring 67 years of LEGO

Everyone loves Lego (unless you ever stepped on one). Did you know by the way that "Lego" was derived from the Danish phrase leg godt, which means "play well"? Unless you speak Danish, probably not. This project analyzed a fascinating dataset on every single lego block that has ever been built!
It is documented in [notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/Exploring-67-years-of-LEGO/blob/master/notebook.ipynb). The raw data files are also stored in the repository.
