# Merging DataFrames with pandas

The data analysis is documented in [Merging_DataFrames_with_pandas.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/Merging-DataFrames-with-pandas/blob/master/Merging_DataFrames_with_pandas.ipynb). The lecture notes and the raw data files are also stored in the repository. The summary of the content is shown below:

- Preparing data: import multiple files into DataFrames and share information between DataFrames using their Indexes

- Concatenating data: append and concatenate DataFrames

- Merging data: merge pandas DataFrames, including left joins, right joins, inner joins, and outer joins, as well as ordered merging.

- Case Study - Summer Olympics
