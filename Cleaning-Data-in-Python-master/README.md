# Cleaning-Data-in-Python

The data analysis is documented in [Cleaning Data in Python.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/Cleaning-Data-in-Python/blob/master/Cleaning%20Data%20in%20Python.ipynb). The lecture notes and the raw data files are also stored in the repository. The summary of the content is shown below:

- Exploring the data: diagnose issues such as outliers, missing values, and duplicate rows.

- Tidying data for analysis: reshape and tidy the data using pivoting and melting.

- Combining data for analysis: combine the data using concating and merging.

- Cleaning data for analysis: use string manipulation and pattern matching to deal with unstructured data, explore techniques to deal with missing or duplicate data, then programmatically check the data for consistency.

- Case study: apply all of the data cleaning techniques owards tidying a real-world, messy dataset obtained from the Gapminder Foundation.
